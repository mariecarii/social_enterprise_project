# social_enterprise_project

## Project Description
We were prompted to create a social enterprise for our class. My group chose to address the issue of food deserts. The idea was we would create a platform that connects people directly to farmers to eliminate middle man costs and making it an easier proccess overall. <br />
Our website allows farmers to sign on, and in blog style, post produce they have for sale and any other info. We also have seperate sections of the site dedictaed to money saving tips and how to get the max out of groceries. 


## Languages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run
Run index.html which will open the website in your browser.

## How to Use
This website was designed to be used for our social enterprise to connect users to farmers. It also offers articles and other feautures to help with money managament, etc.

## Future Plans
I'd like to add more interactive features to the website. I also want to work on adding a backend so registered users, articles, etc. can be stored.
